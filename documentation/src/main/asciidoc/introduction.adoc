== Introduction

The Training App is an ESDK App by the abas Essentials SDK Team to demonstrate the usage of ESDK for ESDK App development.

It contains all currently supported components. You can use it to find out how to configure your project for different components.

It is not meant to be installed in a productive client, it is only a demo project to help you get started with ESDK App development
and for the ESDK Team to test all components work as expected. The project will grow over time as more components are supported.
We also might include special cases and current workarounds.
